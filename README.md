Side Notes for choices and decisions in a few words.

Libraries and packages used: They were Used mostly for saving time purposes, improving the human readability and the user experience, althought my implementation lacks UI, I think converting the date and the country code makes everything more readable! Used bootstrap and it is responsive as well.

    "country-data": "0.0.31",
    "moment": "^2.24.0",
    "moment-timezone": "^0.5.26",
    "react": "^16.10.2",
    "react-dom": "^16.10.2",
    "react-moment": "^0.9.6",
